# Simple Shell - ALX Africa Project

## Description
This project is a simple UNIX command line interpreter, or "shell", built as part of the ALX Africa Software Engineering program.  
It provides a basic command execution environment similar to standard shells like `sh` or `bash`.

---

## Features
- Display a simple prompt and wait for user commands
- Execute basic system commands with their full paths
- Handle command execution with arguments
- Handle errors gracefully (e.g., command not found)
- Built-in commands like `exit`
- Environment variable handling (e.g., accessing PATH)

---

## Requirements
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- gcc compiler (version 9.3.0 or higher)
- Betty style guide for C programming
